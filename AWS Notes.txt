AWS Tutorial 
__________________________

* S3 Bucket 
Bucket name should be unique globally. 
It is a global service.
name is global but bucket is region basic.
by default its a private bucket. 
ACL is enable means bucket is public. 
* Bucket versioning 
to secure the data versioning is a service given by company
data backup. enable or suspend only two options are there. 
you can see the backup in the show version. 

* sharing data from one bucket to another bucket
aws s3 replication service = 	
steps = 1. versioning should be enable at both side
 	2. source to destination 

- create a bucket in one region and another in another region 
- go to management of source bucket 
- replication rule - create repl. - give name - 
- choose rule scope - apply all object 
- destination - 
- create new iam role 
- can replicate multiple bucket like a chain 
- 5gb is the free tier limit in s3
_____________

Host a website in s3 - session 10 
- using cloudfront global service
- edge location = fast access 
- cache policy = to reduce response time 
- latency/time 
- 
_____________________________

AWS S3 storage classes
reduce gets low according to the classes highest is 	standard and lowest is deep archive 
- apply life cycle rule to data for cost saving, 
- have to define duration for life cycle rule. last is 365 days 
- we can change the class of the data but it will require charge to do it
- go to management to apply the lifecycle rule. 
- life cycle action 

1. S3 standard = by default class 
2. S3 intelligent terring 
3. S3 infrequent access
4. S3 one zone inf acc
5. S3 Glacier
6. S3 Glacier flexible 
7. S3 Deep archive

AWS transfer acceleration 
we can accelerate the speed of upload and download using edge location 
just have to enable acceleration in bucket properties.

Iam role - identity access management
important word in iam account for interview
- least preveledge access - not full access
- can create max 5000 iam
- can create 300 group 
- can give maximum 10 permission 
- max 2 access and secret key
- policy type 
	1. existing policy
	2. custom policy 

*session 12 - 
Iam policy = a single policty can be attach to multiple users
you can create policy by visual or json, for json use aws policy generator
